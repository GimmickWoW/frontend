# Gimmick - Frontend

This repository contains the react frontend to Gimmick.

## Development

We recommend the usage of `yarn` instead of `npm` due to some issues with peer dependencies.

### Using yarn (recommended)

```sh
# Install Dependencies
yarn install

# Start the application
yarn start
```

### Using npm

```sh
# Install Dependencies
npm i --legacy-peer-deps

# Start the application
npm start
```
